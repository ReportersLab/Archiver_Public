You can download the AIR file in the release folder. The AIR file will download AIR and install it if you don't have it already. Once installed you can launch the application like you would launch any application.

It's still buggy. When you launch the app the first thing you'll want to do is "manage twitter" and login with your account, that should be pretty straightforward. After that you may or may not get a system login box that appears talking about the Twitter Firehose (this will also appear after you've logged in and opened the app for a second time). CANCEL it. I'm not sure why it pops up, so I'm not sure how to fix it.

Everything should be pretty straightforward. There may be crashes as you navigate, but for the most part it works. 

A connection to Twitter is opened and starts downloading tweets. You can search your saved tweets in the text box in the center. Clicking on a tweet will bring up some details. Same with a user or a place.

The "Monitor Twitter Terms" button on the search page will bring up a box to add terms to your data stream. These will be downloaded along with the tweets from your followers. Be careful! If you add terms that are very popular, the user interface will not update and the application will appear frozen -- it simply won't be able to keep up with the quantity of incoming tweets. Once a term is added, clicking on it in the list below will remove it.

That's all there is to it really. It's super-rough, but should give a general idea of what we were going for.
